    <h1>ROYAL ROBOTICS</h1>
    <h2>TALLAHASSEE & ORLANDO REGIONAL 2025</h2>
  </header>

  <main class="container">
    <p>Royal Robotics competed in FIRST robotics regional events held in Tallahassee and Orlando during their spring break week. The first competition in Tallahassee saw the students work through technical challenges, ultimately fielding a robot that was very competitive. The team was selected for the tournament and finished in <strong>6th place</strong> in a field of 42 teams.</p>
    <p>The team further improved their robot in the more competitive Orlando regional; perfecting their camera-based scoring guidance system for both autonomous and student driven game play. They finished in <strong>8th place</strong> in a field of 61 teams.</p>
    <p>Our robot <strong>Abyss</strong> performed well scoring on both the coral reef and the algae barge using cutting edge technology. It utilized advanced features like AprilTag vision for precise localization, a holonomic drive system for agile movement in any direction, and sensor fusion to optimize real-time decision-making. These innovations powered their autonomous routines, allowing them to navigate the field with accuracy and efficiency. The teamâ€™s ability to blend mechanical precision with software intelligence stood out throughout the competition and earned them a spot among the top-performing teams.</p>

    <h2>ORLANDO REGIONAL 2024</h2>
    <p>At the FIRST Robotics Orlando Competition, Royal Robotics placed <strong>3rd</strong> with their robot the <strong>Royal Bard</strong>. The team went through the entire competition with only 1 loss. This was possible due to the robot's ability to quickly and efficiently pick up game pieces from the floor and consistently score them in the main goal.</p>
    <p>The team also created an ingenious way to climb on the chain very fast and consistent allowing them to gain points. Royal Bard also had holonomic driving capabilities, allowing it to quickly move on the field while avoiding obstructions. With proportional-integrated-derivative (PID) and feedback tuning, Royal Bard's arm quickly moved to the same place every time while also running many simultaneous actions. These include spinning the wheels to shoot, using cameras on the robot to update its odometer, and auto align the arm using QR codes posted around the field. Royal Robotics became captains for the 3rd place team in the elimination tournament that concludes the competition.</p>
